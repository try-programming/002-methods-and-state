# Rules of War

The goal of war is to obtain all the cards

1. Divide the shuffled deck into two piles, one for each play
2. Each turn (or battle) each player turns one card face up
3. The player with the high card adds both cards to the bottom of her deck. 
   1. Card suit does not matter.
   2. Aces are high
4. If the cards are of equal rank, start a war
   1. In a war, the players each turn one card face up and one card face down (for a total of 6 cards in play)
   2. The player with the high card of the new face up cards will add all six cards to the bottom of their deck
   3. If the cards are once again tied, this process is repeated
5. The game ends when one player has all 52 cards and the other player has none.
